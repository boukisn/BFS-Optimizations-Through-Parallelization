# BFS-Optimizations-Through-Parallelization
Authors: Nicholas Boukis & Ethan Wayda

A comparison of optimizations for Breadth-First Search algorithms that utilize parallelization techniques written in C. This includes:

- _Serial_ Queue Oriented BFS
- _Parallel_ Queue Oriented BFS
- _Serial_ Hybrid of Top2Down & Down2Top Methods
- _Parallel_ Hybrid of Top2Down & Down2Top Methods
- _Blocked Parallel_ Hybrid of Top2Down & Down2Top Methods

A presentation of our approach is included in the repository.
